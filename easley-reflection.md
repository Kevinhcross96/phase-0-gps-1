# Reflections with Jae

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
For me, the most difficult part has been remembering to start with git--make your feature branch, do all your work there, instead of getting two steps in and having to start over.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
I did not know how to collaborate on a repository, so this was my first experience working with someone else. Also I learned about __git fetch__ and __git merge__, which seem really important going forward.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
We talked about the difference  between _git pull__ and __git fetch/merge__ commands. Also, how we messed up halfway through because we didn't save a file. We didn't even know we should ask about autosaving in Sublime.

**What still confuses you about Git?**
Merge conflicts still feel intimidating, and it took us a while to figure out how to even activate one (you wouldn't think that making problems would be hard!)

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
Really good! Kevin and I worked well together, and our guide was very hands-off, letting us get practice with the commands and only stepping in to guide us when we were actually stuck. A++ would work with again!
