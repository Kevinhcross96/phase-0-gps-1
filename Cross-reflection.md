Rembering to use Git and GitHub. 

Creating a new repository.

Using the collaboration feature.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Learned what git fetch was and how to properly use it.
Creating repositories on GitHub, and using the collaboration feature.
Approving other people's edits to the repo, merging the files, and resolving merge conflicts.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

Our guide cleared up the difference between git fetch and git pull.
Our guide let us know about autosave in sublime, so that we don't accidentally commit a file with no content.
The guide reminded us to remember to change branches to the one you want to edit, instead of accdientally working on the master.

What still confuses you about Git?
Remembering all of the correct syntax and commands.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Good! I was slightly embarassed forgetting my password and username. My partner was very good about syntax and guiding me when I didn't know what the specifics of each thing was, and our guide let us experiment but stopped us from going down the wrong path to the answer.
